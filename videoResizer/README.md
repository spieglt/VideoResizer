#  Video Resizer

### *"It's vibe coded!"*

This is an iOS app to resize videos so you can save space on your phone or upload them to sites with a low size limit. After being surprised there was no simple way to do this on stock iOS, I started to write a version in UIKit. Once I got something minimally working I realized it would be a good thing to try with an LLM, which used SwiftUI. I had to tell it to fix a few things and update the code for deprecation warnings, but it was pretty easy and very fast.  

- No ads
- No in-app purchases
- No tracking or data collection
